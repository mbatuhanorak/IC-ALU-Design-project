# IC-ALU-Design-project
Design Project: Integrated Circuit ALU

This project was undertaken as part of a Digital IC Design course, focusing on the development of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU design was meticulously crafted to perform essential arithmetic and logic operations crucial for data processing within integrated circuits.

Verilog HDL was employed to systematically describe and simulate the ALU's functionality, ensuring accurate operation before physical implementation. The project utilized the comprehensive capabilities of the OpenLANE flow, integrating synthesis, place and route, and physical verification tools to translate the ALU design into a GDS (Graphic Data System) file.

The GDS file represents the final layout of the ALU at the physical level, suitable for fabrication and integration into larger digital systems. This project not only showcases the design and implementation of a fundamental digital circuit component but also highlights the practical application of modern Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools in the field of integrated circuit design.
